# Modularize-it Branch Details

## Goal
The goal for this branch is to practice building modules. Separate out all the calculation functions into their own files, e.g. the code for `add` can be imported from a different file via the `require` function made available by the NodeJs environment.

Create a module for all the calculations: `add`, `subtract`, `divide`, `multiply`, `validation` if you've completed it before).

Please consider good file structure. Where will you put all these new modules that will be created?

## References
Learn about `module.exports` and `require` from [nodejs.org's docs](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_module_exports).

## Caveats
This branch in meant to only work with the NodeJs platform only. There is no support for running this exercise in the browser environment.
